# DSTV Soccer Guide

I got tired of how difficult the TV schedules (online and native apps) were to use to check times and channels for upcoming matches.

All I care about is the live matches from the English Premier League and Champions League coming up in the next few days.

This [guide](http://guide.definitearticle.co.za/) cuts out all the noise and only displays relevant information. It crawls the data from the json API used on the DSTV website's schedule.
